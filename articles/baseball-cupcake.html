					<h3>From Baseball to Cupcake</h3>
					<p>
						I love to bake and share my creations with others. I am a member at Pinnacle Toastmasters Club in Pittsford, New York. We meet on the second and fourth Wednesdays each month. 
						For each meeting, I challenge myself to bring in a baked good and to share with the club members. In addition, the baked good should have some sort of connection to the meeting's theme of the day.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today's theme is "take me out to the ball game." This was a tricky one. I could not immediately think of a dessert that screams, "baseball!" I recalled a song by Albert Von Tilzer titled, 
						<cite>"Take Me Out to the Ball Game"</cite> (coincidentally the meeting's theme in verbatim). I sung the song in my head. Until I reached the line, <q>"buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks,"</q> I suddenly had an epiphany. 
						I could make a cracker jack cupcake! Why stop there? I took it a step further by taking each component of what constitutes a cupcake and have it represent the different aspects of cracker jacks. 
						For instance, the cake itself will be made out of sweet and buttery cornbread cake to represent the popcorn. The filling will be a luscious salted caramel cream to represent the caramel. 
						The cupcake will be topped with a rich, peanut buttercream frosting to represent the peanuts. Finally, the cupcake will be adorned with cracker jacks popcorn on top of the frosting.
					</p>
					<p>	
						I have a simple trick I like to incorporate into my baking. Whenever a recipe calls for melted butter, I like to substitute it with brown butter such as in the cupcake batter. Brown butter is easy to prepare. 
						It requires you to heat butter past its boiling point, and stop once you observe brown specs forming on the bottom. Those brown specs provide rich, toasty flavors, which elevates your baked good experience 
						to a whole other level of flavor profiles. <strong>I strongly recommend you add it into a chocolate chip cookie recipe.</strong>
					</p>
					<h3>The Recipe</h3>
					<p>
						I get my inspiration by googling various recipes. Here is the recipe I used to create the cracker jack cupcakes with some modifications:
